# ApiCallDebouce

In order to improve the performance of your Angular, Rxjs provides some nice operators to help us working with data stream.
debounceTime() is one of those operators that save us to write a custom JavaScript code yet improves the code readability, performance and fluidity.

This project has the goal to implement a debounceTime Rxjs operator in a input search, where it sends an GET request to an API at debouce time.
